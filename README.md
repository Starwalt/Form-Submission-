The "405 Not Allowed" error typically arises when the server doesnâ€™t allow the requested HTTP method for the specified URL. In the context of GitHub Pages hosting, which is primarily intended for static content and doesn't support server-side scripting or dynamic processing (like PHP), trying to access a PHP file (`process_form.php`) directly will result in this error.

To handle form submissions securely on GitHub Pages, you'll need to use an external service or solution capable of processing form data. Here's an example using Formspree, a service that allows form submissions without server-side scripting:

### Using Formspree:

1. **Sign up on Formspree:**

   - Go to [Formspree website](https://formspree.io/) and sign up for an account.
   - Follow the steps to authenticate your email address.

2. **Update your HTML form:**

   Modify your HTML form to send data to Formspree's endpoint by setting the `action` attribute to Formspree's endpoint and specifying the desired method (`POST`):

   ```html
   <form action="https://formspree.io/your_email_here" method="POST">
     <!-- Your form fields -->
     <input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="First Name" required />
     <!-- Other form fields -->
     <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
   </form>
   ```

   Replace `"https://formspree.io/your_email_here"` with the actual email you used to sign up on Formspree.

3. **Handle submissions on Formspree:**

   - Formspree will handle the form submissions for you. When a user submits the form, Formspree will collect the data and send it to the specified email address.

4. **Configure Formspree:**

   - Log in to your Formspree account and navigate to the form to see the submissions.

By using Formspree or similar third-party services, you can handle form submissions securely without the need for server-side scripting on GitHub Pages. These services manage the form submissions, validate the data, and forward it to your specified email address, eliminating the need for server-side processing on your hosting platform.

Remember to follow the documentation provided by Formspree or any chosen service for proper setup and configuration based on your specific requirements.
